# Document Review Perspectives

When asked to review a document, refer to the following perspectives.
(The necessary perspectives will change depending on the content of the document, so please select as appropriate.)

This document describes perspectives for writing documentation that is quick, easy to understand, and accurate for the reader.

The output format for review results should be as follows:

-   Provide an overall evaluation.
-   For each perspective and confirmation item, clearly describe the points of feedback (current situation and proposed corrections).
-   Mark confirmation items with a ⭐️ in the output as well.
-   Do not omit any noticed points; describe them as feedback.

⭐️: Items considered to be of high importance.

### 1. Review Request (To proceed smoothly with the review)

Matters that should be clearly communicated to the reviewer when requesting a review.
This improves the quality and time efficiency of the review.

-   **Communicate the purpose and background of the document**
    -   Clearly state "what this document aims to solve" and "what is the background for its creation."
-   **Indicate the goal of the review**
    -   Tell the reviewer what you expect from them.
    -   Indicate a specific goal, such as "I want you to approve ~," "I want your opinion on ~," or "I want you to be a sounding board for ideas."
-   **If there are specific parts you want them to focus on, let them know**
    -   By specifically indicating the parts you are not confident about or the points you want to discuss, it becomes easier for the reviewer to know where to focus.

### 2. Structure and Logical Development (Is the story easy to follow?)

Perspectives on the overall structure and flow of the document.
Check whether the reader can understand the content without stress.

-   **Presentation of the overall picture**
    -   At the beginning, provide a summary or conclusion of the whole document.
    -   ⭐️Clearly state "which part of the overall system this is about," clarifying where the subject of discussion fits into the whole.
-   **Logical structure**
    -   Is the flow of the story logical (e.g., PREP method, Background → Problem → Proposal → Details → Conclusion)?
    -   ⭐️In developing the logic, is the current situation organized first?
    -   Do the headings of each section accurately represent the content?
    -   Is the connection between sections natural (i.e., no abrupt new topics)?
-   **Order and granularity of information**
    -   Are prerequisite knowledge or decisions presented later in the document?
    -   Is information unknown to the reader used without explanation?
    -   Are non-essential details separated from the main text (e.g., summarized in an Appendix)?

### 3. Clarity and Persuasiveness of Content (Are the claims and evidence solid?)

Perspectives on the quality of the content itself.
Check whether the claims are persuasive and communicated without misunderstanding.

-   **Claims and conclusions**
    -   ⭐️Instead of just listing data and multiple proposals, is your own claim or proposal clearly written (i.e., not leaving the decision entirely to the reviewer)?
    -   ⭐️Is the conclusion logically connected to the research results and considerations?
    -   ⭐️Is it explained in terms of what the expected value was and what the actual result was?
        -   Without an expected value, it is difficult to interpret the results alone.
    -   (If any) Are future issues and next actions also mentioned?
-   **Separation of facts and opinions**
    -   Are objective "facts (data, events)" and the writer's "opinions (considerations, speculations)" written separately?
-   **Data and analysis**
    -   Is the source of the data (acquisition method) explained?
        -   When data is counter-intuitive, the reviewer may want to know specifically how that data was obtained.
        -   Also, to make it easy to perform the same aggregation after some time, link the queries used, etc.
    -   Is the analysis and comparison of the collected information sufficient?
    -   ⭐️What is the proportion of that data in the whole?
        -   For example, even if there is unfavorable data, if the proportion is extremely small, ignoring it might be an option.
-   **Clarity of expression**
    -   Is the content of the claim written so that it can be interpreted unambiguously (i.e., no ambiguous expressions)?

### 4. Consistency and Clarity of Expression (Is it easy to read?)

Perspectives on the methods of expression, such as text, diagrams, and tables.
Check whether the cognitive load is low and the content is intuitively understandable.

-   **Terminology and expressions**
    -   ⭐️Are you conscious of the reader's context?
        -   Are you overusing technical terms that are not understood, or talking about fine details of code that are not understood?
    -   Are words with the same meaning written with multiple expressions (prevention of inconsistent notation)?
    -   ⭐️Especially for new concepts, is the naming appropriate? Is the definition clearly indicated?
-   **Diagrams, tables, graphs, and numbers**
    -   Is complex content expressed in an easy-to-understand manner using diagrams and tables in addition to text?
    -   ⭐️Is it clear what the diagram/table/graph is trying to convey?
        -   Are titles, explanations of the vertical and horizontal axes, legends, and supplementary explanations provided?
        -   Is there not too much information?
    -   Do the axes and scales of the graph not invite misinterpretation?
    -   Are units stated for numerical values?
    -   ⭐️When listing numbers, are工夫 (ingenuity/devices) used to make them easier to compare, such as aligning the number of digits and commas, or unifying to right alignment?

### 5. Self-Review (Basic quality)

Minimum checklist items that the creator should check themselves before submitting the document.

-   Are there any typos, omissions, or unnatural phrasing?
-   Is there any inconsistent notation?
-   Have you reread it yourself and checked for any discomfort in the logical development?
-   Does it seem understandable to a third party or your future self?
-   Is there any description that has become inconsistent due to correcting the pointed-out content?
